# playground-nodemon
`playground-nodemon` is a Node.js plauyground project using TypeScript, Webpack, Axios, and Express to interact with example APIs.

Current APIs included
- the Pokémon API. The project allows you to fetch Pokémon data from the Pokémon API and display it in a structured format via an Express server.

### **Installation and Setup**

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

#### **Prerequisites**
- Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
- Install the required dependencies by running the setup script.

#### **Step-by-Step Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/playground-nodemon.git
   cd playground-nodemon
   ```
2. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
4. **Access the Server**:
   Once the setup is complete, the server will be running at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

### **Usage**

To interact with the Pokémon API, you can make a GET request to the following endpoint:

- **GET /pokemon/:name**

Replace `:name` with any Pokémon name to get data about that Pokémon. For example, to get data about Pikachu:

```
GET http://localhost:3000/pokemon/pikachu
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "pikachu",
    "height": 4,
    "weight": 60,
    "base_experience": 112,
    "abilities": [
      {
        "ability": {
          "name": "static",
          "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/9/"
        }
      },
      {
        "ability": {
          "name": "lightning-rod",
          "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/31/"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "status": 200
}
```

### **API Endpoints**

- **GET /pokemon/:name**:
  - Fetch Pokémon data from the Pokémon API.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `name` (string): The name of the Pokémon you want to retrieve (e.g., `pikachu`, `charizard`).
  - **Response**:
    - `status`: HTTP status code.
    - `data`: Pokémon information, including name, height, weight, base experience, and abilities.

### **Project Dependencies**

This project uses the following dependencies:

#### **Core Dependencies**:
- [express](https://expressjs.com/): Web framework for Node.js.
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the Pokémon API.

#### **Dev Dependencies**:
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript for static typing.
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): Bundler for compiling TypeScript and JavaScript files.
- [babel](https://babeljs.io/): Transpiling TypeScript and ES6+ to compatible JavaScript for Node.js.
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/): Automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

---

### **Scripts**

Here are the key npm scripts defined in the `package.json` file:

- **`npm run build`**: Bundles the TypeScript files using Webpack into the `dist` folder.
  
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **`npm start`**: Starts the server with **Nodemon** (automatically watches for file changes and restarts the server).
  
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **`npm run dev`**: (Optional) You can configure this script to run the development build with Webpack watch mode if needed.

### **Additional Notes**

- **Why Axios?**
  - Axios is used to interact with the Pokémon API. It's a simple promise-based HTTP client that simplifies HTTP requests and responses.
  
- **Why Webpack and Babel?**
  - Webpack and Babel are used to bundle the TypeScript files and transpile them into JavaScript that can be run in Node.js.

- **Nodemon**:
  - Nodemon is used during development to automatically restart the server whenever a file changes, improving the developer experience.
